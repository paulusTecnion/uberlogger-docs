Welcome to the Uberlogger User Manual. The Uberlogger allows you to measure and record voltage, temperature, and digital inputs. With its ability to log and store data directly to an SD card in the universally readable CSV (Comma Separated Values) format, Uberlogger is a simple, yet powerful measurement device.

This manual will guide you through all aspects of the Uberlogger: from [quickstarting](/Manual/Quickstart) it, configuring the logger, firmware upgrade and troubleshooting. If you still encounter any issues or have questions while using the Uberlogger, please contact the support team.

Happy logging!

## Safety Precautions

### Voltage Limitations

The Uberlogger is designed to operate with a 5V power supply only. Do
not attempt to power the device with a voltage higher than 5V, as it may
cause permanent damage to the device and void the warranty. The maximum
voltage that the device can handle on the inputs is +/- 60V. Exceeding
this voltage range may lead to unsafe situations to the user and may
break the Uberlogger.

### Temperature Range

The Uberlogger is suitable for use in environments with temperatures
ranging from 10 °C to +50°C. Operating the device outside this
temperature range may lead to inaccurate measurements or damage to
internal components.

### Storage Temperature

When not in use, store the Uberlogger in a dry, cool environment within
the temperature range of 10°C to +40°C.

### USB-C Connector

Use only the provided USB-C cable or compatible accessories to connect
the Uberlogger to a USB-C port or a 5V power supply. Using non-certified
cables may lead to electrical issues or malfunction.

### Power Supply Current

Ensure the power supply used to power the Uberlogger provides a minimum
current of 300mA. Using a power supply with lower current may result in
unreliable performance or data loss.

### Avoid Water Exposure

The Uberlogger is not water-resistant, so keep it away from liquids and
moisture to prevent damage.

### Secure Mounting

When using the Uberlogger, ensure it is securely mounted or positioned
in a stable manner to prevent accidental falls or damage during
operation.

### Environmental Conditions

Operate the Uberlogger within the specified temperature range (15°C to
+50°C) and avoid exposing it to extreme temperatures or environmental
conditions that could affect its performance.

### Proper Power Down

Always power off the Uberlogger properly before disconnecting it from
the power source or USB-C port to prevent data corruption and ensure a
safe shutdown.

### Adherence to Local Regulations:

Comply with all relevant safety regulations, codes, and standards
applicable in your area when using the Uberlogger.

By following these safety precautions, you can ensure the safe and
reliable operation of the Uberlogger while utilizing its capabilities
for precise voltage and temperature data acquisition in a wide range of
environments and applications.
