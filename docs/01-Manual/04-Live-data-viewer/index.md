# Live Data viewer

Your Uberlogger is set to display all live data from your channel inputs
by default. If any NTCs are enabled, the temperature will be shown in
degrees Celsius. You can also see live values during logging. Refresh
rates are always limited to 1 Hz.

:::info[Note]

When logging data and having a sample frequency of 1, 2 or 5 Hz, it may take up to 70 seconds before data is shown in the live data viewer.
